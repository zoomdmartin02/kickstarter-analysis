# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Prepared for Louise, by David Martin on 10/4/20

## Overview of Project
---
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Louise would like to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.  This project will evaluate all Crowdfunding projects from years 2010 through 2017 in the United States, focusing on Theater as a category and Plays as a subcategory.  It will provide trend analysis and make recommendations to Louise about most successful goals and timelines to launch a funding campaign based on the historical data.

## Analysis and Challenges
---
The fund-raising campaign for Fever started on June 13, 2016 and ended on July 11, 2016.  This campaign had a goal of raising $2,885 to fund the production of the play, but fell short of the goal with actual donations totaling $2,485.  There were 10 backers who gave an average donation of $248.50.  Louise has indicated that a minimum of $4000 is needed to fund her play.
---
The challenge will be to analyze the available data and determine any factors Louise can use to plan her new funding campaign by looking at successful campaigns that met the pledge goals.  Challenges do exist with the data.  For example, the data in years 2010-2013 have very few funding campaigns included.  There are fewer than 11 campaigns per year, respectively with 11 being the highest in 2013.  From 2014-2016, there sufficient sample sizes to draw some inferences.  2017 again lags with only 48 total programs.  We will use the entire data set from 2010 through 2017 and draw the best inferences possible from the available data.

To begin, we will look at the data summarized from two perpectives:
---
* Outcomes based on Campaign Goal Size
* Outcomes based on Launch Date Timing

### Campaign Goal Analysis

#### Table 1 - Campaigns by Size, Qty and Outcome ![Table 1 - Campaigns by Size, Qty and Outcome](Resources/Table_of_Outcomes_by_Goal.png)
---
#### Table 2 - Campaigns by Size and Outcome Percentage ![Table 2 - Campaigns by Size and Outcome %](Resources/Table_of_Outcomes_by_percent.png)
---
Based on the above summary data, campaigns in the range of $1000 to $5000 were highly successful.  Also, since this is the indicated size campaign desired, there are many examples to draw from to provide insight into the needed campaign for Louise.
